# Security Operations Model - Functions and Tools
While the assignment of responsibilities to individual people and teams vary based on organization size and other factors security oepartions are composed of several distinct functions. Each function/team has a primary focus area and alo must collaborate closely with other functions and outside teams to be effective. This diagram depicts the full model with fully staffed teams. In Smaller organizations, these functions are often combined into a single role or team, perfromed by IT operations, or are perfromed as a temporary function by leadership delegates fo rincident management.

# Triage and Automation
Reactive alerts

- Automation - near real-time resolution of known incident types with automation. These are well-defined attacks that the orgnization has seen many times.
- Triage - Triage analysts focus on rapid remediation of high  volume of well-known incident types that still require human judgment. These are often tasked with approving automated remediation workflows and identigyin anything anomalous or interesting that warrant escalation or consultation with investigation teams.

Key learnerss for Triage and Automation
- 90% true positive - we recommend setting a quality standard of 90% true positive for any alert feeds that require an analyst to respond to analysts aren't required to respond to high volume of false alarms
- Alert Ratio - In MS experincie from our Cyber Defense opeartions center, XDR alerts produce most of the high-quality alerts, with the remainders coming from user rported issues, classic log query based alerts, and other sources.
- Automation is a key enabler for triage teams as it helps empower these analyst and reduce the burdern o f manual effort
- Tool Integration - one of the most powerful time saving technologies that improved time to remediation in MS CDOC is the integration of XDR tools together into MS Defender so anlysts have a single console for endpoint, email, identity , and more. This integration enables analysts to rapidly discover and clean up attacker phishing emails, malware, and compromised accounts before they can do significant damage.
- Focus These teams can't maintain their high speed of resolution for all types of technologies and scenarios, so tthey keep their focus narrow on a few technical areas and or scenarios. Most often this is on the user productivity,  like email, endpoint AV alerts, and first response for user reports.

# Investigation and Incident managemnt Tier 2
This team serves as the escalation ppoint for issues from Triage, and directly monitors alerts that indicate a more sophisticated attacker. Specifically alerts that trigger heavioral alerts, special case alerts related to buiness-ritical assets, and monitoring ofr ongoing attack ccampaings. Proactively, this team also peridocally reviews the Triage team alert queue and can practively hunt using XDR tools in their spare time. 

This team provides deeper investigation into a lower volue of more complex attacks, often multi-sstage attacks conducted by human attack operators. This team pilots new/unfamiliar alert types to cocument processes for Triage team and auotmation, often including alerts generated by MS defender for cloud on cloud hosted apps, VMs, containers and Kubernetes

Incident Managment - This Team takes on te nontechnical aspects of managing incidents including corrdinatino with other teams like communications, legal, leadership, and other buiness stakeholder. 

# Hunt and Incident Managemnt
This a multi-disciplinary team focused on identifying attackers that could have slipped through the reactive detections and handling major buisness -impacting events. 

- Hunt this team proactively  hunts for undetected threats, assists with secalations and advanced forensics for reactive investigations, adn refines alerts automation. These teams operate in more of a hypothesis-driven model than a reactive alert model and are also where re/purple teams connect with security oeprations.

# How it comes together

1. Triage (tier 1) analyst claims a malware alert from the queue and investigates
2. While most Triage cases are rapidly remediated and closed, this time the analyst observers that malware might require more involved/advanced remediation. Traige esclates the case to the Investigation analyst (Tier 2), who takes lead for investiation. The Triage team has options to stay involved an learn more
3. Investigation verifies investigation conclusions and proceeds with remediation, closes cases
4. Later Hunt (Tier 3) might ntoice this case whil reviewing clsoed incidents to scan for commonalitites or anomalies worht digging into
  - Detections that might be eligible for autoremediation
  - Multiple similar incidents  that might have a common root cause
  - Other potential  process/tool/alert improvements  in one casse, Tier 3 reviewed the case and foudn that the user had fallen for a tech scam. This detection was then flagged as a potentially higher priority alert beccuase the scammers had managed to get admin level access on the endpoint. A higher risk exposure.

# Threat intelligence
Threat Intelligence teams provide context and insights to support all other functions

 - Reactive technical research for active incidents
 - Proactive technical research into attacker groups, attack trends, high profile attacks, emerging techniques, etc
 - Strategic analysis, research, and insights to infrorm business and technical processes and priorities
 -
