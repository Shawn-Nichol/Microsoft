# Zero Trust Initiatives
As an alternative to deployment guidance that provides detailed configuration steps for each of the tecnology pillars being protected by ZeroTrust principles, Rapid Modernization Plan guidance is based on initiatives and givees you a set of deployment paths to more quickly implement key layers of protection.

RaMP guidance takes a project management and checklist approach:
- By provding a suggested mapping of key stakeholders, implementers, and their accountabilitites, you can more quickly organize an internal project and define the tasks and owners to drive them to conclusion.
- By providing a checklist of deployment objectives  and implementations steps you can see th bigger picture f infastructure requirements and track your progress. 


# RaMP initiattive for Zero Trust
Zero trust is a major transformation of security program, so its crivital to start with th emost impactful items that get you the most security adn productivity increases with the least amount of time and resources. 

Provides best practices that help you prioritize your security modernization. This RaMp identifies the most effective controls for the most relevant and common attacks that require the least amount of investment of time, effort, and resources.

The Zero Trust RaMP aligns to the recommended security modernization initiatives, including the following.

- Secure Identities and Access: These quick wins focus on using cloud based security capabiltities like MS Entra control to increasee productivity and security assurances.

- Data Security and Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC) These quick wins focus on ensuring the orgnaization can rapidly recover from a ransomware/extortion attack without paying attackers and prtecting the most valuable buiness critical data.

- Modern Securiyt Operations: These quick wins focus on streamlining responses to common attacks, getting end to end visbility across the enterprise, and automating manual tasks that slow down analyst and cause exhaustion/burnout.

- Infrastructure and Development Security: These quick wins focus on security hygiene, reducing legacy risk, integrating securyit into DevOps and development processes, and applying the microsegmentation concepts to identiy and network access control.

- Operation Technology and IoT security: These quick wins focus on quickly discovering protecting and monitoring these systems for attacks.
