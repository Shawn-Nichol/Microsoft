# Zero Trust
MS Zero Trust approach to security is based on three principles: assume breach, verify explicitly, and least privilege. 

## Guiding Principles
- Verify Explicitly: always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- Use Least privilege access: limit user access with Just-in-time and Just-Enough-Access, risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection
- Assume breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.


The Zero trust model teaches us to never trust, and always verify. 


Zero trust should be implemented across six foundational elements
