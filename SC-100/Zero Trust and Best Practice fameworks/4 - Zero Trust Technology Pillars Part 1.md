# Zero Trust Technology pillars Part 1
A more comprehensive guide on rolling out Zero Trust, the deployment plans provide in-depth guidance. 

Unlike the checklist format of RaMP, deployment solutions weave together resources across products and services. 

# Visibility, automation, and orchestration with Zero Trust
with each of the otehr teechnical pillars of Zero Trust generating their own relevant alerts, we need an integrated capability to manage the resulting influx of data to better defend agains threats and validate trust in a transaction.

Whenever possible it is desriable to automate remediation steps, becuase it reduces the time itt takes for a SOC analyst to address the trheat and move onto the next incident. 

# Visibility automation, and orchestration Zero trustt deployment objectives. 
When implementing and ent-to-end Zero Trust famework for visibility, automation, and orchestartion we recommendd you focus first on these intial deployment objectives. 

1. Establish visbility
2. Enable automation

After these are completed focus on these additioanl deployement objectives

3. Enable additioanl protection and detection controls

# Securing Idnetity with Zero trust
Before and identity attempts to accesses a resource, organizations must

- Veirfy the identy awith storng authentication.
- Ensure access is compliant and typical tfor that identity.
- Follows least privilege access principles

Once the identity has been verified we can control that identiy acces sto resources  based on organization policies, on-going risk analysis, and other tools. 


# Identity Zero Trust Deployment Objectives. 
When implementing an end-toend ZeroTrust framework ofr identity, we reommend you focus first on these intial deoployement objectives. 

1. Cloud idntity federates with  on-premises identity systems
2. Conditiaonl Access policies gate access an dprovide remediation activites
3. Analytics imrpove visbility

# Applications.
To get the full benefit of cloud apps and services, organizations must find the right balance of provding access while maintiaing control to protect critical data accessed via applications and APIs

The Zero Trust model helps orantizations enaure that apps, mand the data they contain are protecte by 
- Applying controls and technologies to discover Shadow IT
- Ensuring approriate in-app permissions
- Limiting acces base don real-time analytics
- Montittoring for abnormal behaivor
- Controlling user actions
- Validating secure configuration options

# Applicatonis Zero Trust deployement objectives
Before most organization start the Zero Trust journey, their on-premises apps are accessed through physical networks or VPN, and some critical cloud apps are accessible to users. 

Inital deployment objectives
- Gain Visibility into the activities and ata in your applications by connecting them via APIs
- Discover and control the user of Shadow IT
- Protect sensitive informatinoa d activities automatically by implementing policies.

After these are completed focus on these
- Deploy adaptive access and session controls for all apps
- Stengthen protection against cyber threats and rogue apps
- Acess the security posture of your cloud environements.
