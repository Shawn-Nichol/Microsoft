# Intent
Cloud-based infrastructure fundamentally changes how your organization finds, uses, and secures technology resources. Traditionally, organizations assumed ownership of and responsibility for all aspects of their technology, from infrastructure to software. Moving to the cloud instead allows your organization to provision and consume resources only when needed.  Although the cloud offers tremendous design choice flexibility, your organization needs a proven and consistent methodology for adopting cloud technologies to ensure success. The MS cloud adoption Framework for Azure meets that need, helping guide your decisions throughout your cloud adoption journey. 

Cloud adoption is a means to an end. Successful cloud adoption begins well before any cloud platform vendor is selected; it begins when business and IT decision-makers realize that the cloud can accelerate a specific business transformation goal. The cloud adoption Framework helps decision-makers align strategies for business, culture and technical change to achieve desired business outcomes. 

The cloud adoption Famwork provides technical guidance for MS Azure. Enterprise customers might still try to select a cloud vendor or have an international multi-cloud strategy. 

## Intended Audiences

THis collection of guides is  designed to drive decision-making and help cloud architects have the right conversations with the right audiences. Business transformation empowered by the cloud relies on the cloud architect role to help guide decisions throughout the organization and IT.
