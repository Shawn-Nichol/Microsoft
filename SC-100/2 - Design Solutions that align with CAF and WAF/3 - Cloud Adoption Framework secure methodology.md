# Cloud adoption Framework secure methodology 
Just as cloud adoption is a journey, cloud security is also an ongoing journey of incremental progress and maturity, not a static destination.

# Envinsion a Security end state
a journey without a target destination is just wandering. While this approach might eventually lead  to enlightenment, business goals and constraints often require focusing on objectives and key results. 

The Secure methodology provides a vision of the complete end stat to guide the improvement of your security program over time. The following infographic visually maps the key ways that security integrates with the larger organization and disciplines within security.

# Mapping to concepts, frameworks, and standards
Security itself is both a standalone organization discipline and a quality/attribute that is integrated or overlaid on other disciplines, making it challenging to define and map in detail precisely. The security industry uses many frameworks to capture risk, plan controls, and operate. 

- Zero Trust: MS believes all security disciplines should follow the zero-trust principles of assuming breach, verifying explicitly, and using least privilege access. These principles underpin any sound security strategy and must be balanced with business enablement goals. The first and most visible part of zero trust is access control, which is highlighted in the description of the access control security discipline.

- The Open Group: These security disciplines closely map to the core principles' zero-trust components. The one notable exception is that MS elevated the discipline of innovation security so that DevSecOps is a top-level element because of how new, important, and transformative this discipline is for many organizations

- NIST: for organizations that use NIST, we have highlighted bold text where the framework most closely maps. Modern access control and DevSecOps map broadly to the full spectrum of the framework, so those items aren't noted individually.


# Mapping Roles and responsibilities
While security is a highly technical discipline, It's first and foremost a human discipline reflective of the long history of human conflict.

# Security Transformation
As organizations adopt the cloud, they quickly find that static security processes cannot keep up with the pace of change in cloud platforms, the threat environment, and the evolution of security technologies. Security must shift to a continuously evolving approach to match the pace with this change that will transform organizational culture and daily processes. 

# Change drivers
Security organizations are experiencing two types of major transformation at the same time.

- Security as business risk: Security has been propelled into business risk management from a purely technical quality-oriented discipline.
    -   Digital Transformation: Increases in digital footprint are continuously increasing the potential attack surface of the organization.
    -   Threat landscape: Increases in attack volume and sophistication fueled by an industrialized attack economy with specialized skills and continual commoditization of attack tools and techniques.
-   Platform changes: security is also grappling with a technical change to the cloud. This shift is on the scale of factories shifting from running their electrical generators to plugging into an electrical grid. While security teams often have the right foundational skills, they are becoming overwhelmed by the changes to nearly every process and technology they use daily. 
- Shift in expectations: digital innovation has redefined entire industries in the past decade. Business agility, especially agility related to digital transformation, can quickly unseat an organization as a market leader. Likewise, a loss of consumer confidence can impact the business. While it was once acceptable for security to start with no to block a project and protect the organization, the urgency of embracing digital transformation must change the engagement model to let's talk about how to stay safe. At the same time, you do what is needed to stay relevant. 

# Guiding Lasting Transformation
Key areas to drive success

- Culture The culture of security must be focused on safely meeting the business mission, not impeding it. At the same time, security must become a normalized part of the organization's culture as the internet upon which the business operates is open, allowing adversaries to attempt attacks at any time. This cultural shift requires an improved process, partnerships, and ongoing leadership support at all levels to communicate the change, model the behavior, and reinforce the shift.

- Risk ownership: The accountability for security risk should be assigned to the same roles that own all other risks, freeing security up to be a trusted advisor and subject matter expert rather than a scapegoat. Security should be responsible for sound and balanced advice communicated in those leaders' language but not held accountable for decisions they do not own.

- Security talent: Security talent is in a chronic shortage, and organizations should always be planning how to develop best and distribute security knowledge and skills. In addition to growing security teams directly with technical security skill sets, mature security teams are also diversifying their strategy by focusing on
    -   Growing security skill sets and knowledge with existing IT and business teams. This is especially important for DevOps teams with a DevSecOps approach and can take many forms
    -   Recruiting diverse skill sets to security teams to bring fresh perspectives and frameworks to problems and build better relationships within the organization. 

# Business alignment
Risk insights: align and integrate security insights and risk signals/sources into business initiatives. Ensure repeatable processes, educate all teams on applying those insights, and hold teams accountable for improvements.

Security integration: Integrate security knowledge, skills, and insights deeper into the daily operation of the business and IT environment via repeatable processes and eep partnership at all levels of the organization

Operational resiliency: Focus on ensuring the organization is resilient by continuing operation during an attack and that the organization rapidly bounces back to full operation. 

## Security Disciplines
The transformation will affect each security discipline differently. While each of these disciplines is extremely important and requires investment, these are ordered by which ones have the most immediate opportunities for quick wins as you adopt the cloud. 

Access control - Application of network and identity create access boundaries and segmentation to reduce the frequency and reach of any security breaches

Security operations - Monitor IT operations to detect, respond, and recover from breaches. Use data to continuously reduce the risk of breach.

Asset protection - Maximize protection of all assets

Security Governance - Delegated decisions accelerate innovation and introduce new risks. Monitor decisions, configurations, and data to govern decisions made across the environment and within all workloads across the portfolio.

Innovation security - As an organization adopts DevOps models to increase the pace of innovation, security must become an integral part of a DevSecOps process and integrate security expertise and resources directly into this high-speed cycle. This involves shifting some decision-making from centralized teams to empower workload-focused teams.

# Guiding principles
All security activities should be aligned to and shaped by a dual focus on

- Business enablement: Align to the organization's business objectives and risk framework
- Security assurances: Focused on applying zero trust principles of
    - Assume breach When designing security for any component or system, reduce the risk of attackers expanding access by assuming other resources in the organization are compromised
    - Explicit verification: Validate trust using all available data points rather than assuming trust.
    - Least-privileged access: Limit the risk of a compromised user or resource by providing just-in-time and just-enough-access, risk-based adaptive policies and data protection. to help secure both data nad productivity.
